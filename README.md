# news-explorer-frontend

## **By Carolina Toren**

Front-End part of my final project at Practicum by Yandex program.

In this project, I've used all the technologies I've learned over the span of the program, including:

- Working with Figma design and specifications
- Using Grid layout, flex and media queries
- Use React.js and CRA
- Work with React router, using redirect and protected routes
- Work with functional and class components
- Create popups and controlled forms and implement their behavior and interaction between them
- RESTful API (this project is connected to two API's- one that I built myself and one external of a news site)
- Asyncronous API
- Authoriztion and Authentication using JWT
- Work with local storage
- Use React useCallback
- Use states, hooks and contexts
- Error handaling
  And more...

The project contains lots of small details that require a lot of hard work, such as:

- Different header for loggedin / unauthorized user.
- Changing tooltips for loggedin / unauthorized user and according to app location.
- Different navigation bar for desktop / mobile screens.
- Dynamic components which are changing according to location and log In state.
  etc..
